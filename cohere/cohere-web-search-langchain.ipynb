      "an RBI sacrifice fly for Arizona, scoring Corbin Carroll, and Gurriel hit a three-run home run to reduce their deficit to 11–5. In the ninth inning, Will Smith recorded two outs, but the Diamondbacks put two men on base. José Leclerc entered the game and gave up a two-run RBI single to Gabriel Moreno, but finished the game with a pop-up by Christian Walker.[48] With the win, the Rangers put themselves one win away from their first-ever World Series championship. This also extended the Rangers' 2023 postseason road win streak to ten games.[49]\n",

      "This was the first postseason meeting between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Both teams lost over 100 games in 2021.[1] The teams' 174 combined wins is the lowest ever total for a non-shortened season World Series.[2] This was the third World Series to feature two wild card teams, after 2002 and 2014.[3] This was the first World Series between one team that has never won in any prior appearances and another team that has never lost in any prior appearances. MLB has paired these two teams up as interleague rivals from 1998 to 2000 and in 2013, 2019, and since 2023. This was the fifth straight World Series to have games played in a venue in Texas, with Houston co-hosting in 2019, 2021, and 2022, and Arlington hosting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\n",
