It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance.
