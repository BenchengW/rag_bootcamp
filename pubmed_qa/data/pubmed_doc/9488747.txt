Apparent life-threatening events in infants are a difficult and frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Eight infants aged 2 to 15 months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without baths. After a 2-7 year follow-up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer from troubles associated with sun or water.
