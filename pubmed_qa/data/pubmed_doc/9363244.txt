To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity. The frequency of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation dose and abnormal spermiograms.
