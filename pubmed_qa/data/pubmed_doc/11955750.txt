To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the median scleral dose 546 Gy. After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led to poor central vision in 30% of cases.
