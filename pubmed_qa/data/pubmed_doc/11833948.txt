To detemine the relationship between delay in transfer to rehabilitation wards and outcome for patients aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur. An observational study in a district general hospital of all patients admitted to hospital aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal femur over 3 1/2 years. Outcome data collected included the number of patients discharged back to their usual residence and total hospital length of stay related to age, gender, usual residence and delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward. 58% of 455 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation ward. For those patients who were transferred to a rehabilitation ward only age predicted discharge to a more dependent residence. The relative risk for discharge to a more dependent residence for people aged over 85 years compared to younger people was 1.47 (95% CI 1.15-1.88). Delay in transfer to rehabilitation was associated with a longer total hospital length of stay of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23-1.05) days per day of delay in transfer.
