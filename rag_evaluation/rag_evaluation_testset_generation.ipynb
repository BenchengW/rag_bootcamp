    "# RAG Evaluation Test Set Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) framework to generate a **test set** that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline. We then use the Python [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) library to run some requests through this pipeline and we evaluate the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- You will need an access key to OpenAI's API key, which you can sign up for at (https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login). A free trial account will suffice, but will be limited to a small number of requests.\n",
    "- After obtaining this key, store it in plain text in your home in directory in the `~/.openai.key` file.\n",
    "- (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."

The institute is focused on advancing the frontiers of AI knowledge through research, education, and engineering new applications of AI in various industries. They work with a team of applied machine learning experts to push the boundaries of AI innovation and provide learning opportunities for students, postdoctoral fellows, and recent graduates in machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, Vector Institute is committed to developing programming for Black and Indigenous students to expand career pathways in AI for historically underrepresented groups, aiming towards greater inclusion in the field of AI.\n",
