# RAG Bootcamp

This is a collection of reference implementations for Vector Institute's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) bootcamp, scheduled to take place in 2024.

## Reference Implementations

### MedGPT

Look under the `/medgpt` folder. This reference implementation requires an OpenAI API key.

## Python environment

We are trying to make a single Python virtual environment that will work for all the reference implementations included here. This may change in the future, but for now you can access this environment with the following commands:

```
cd /ssd003/projects/aieng/public/rag_bootcamp
source rag_venv/bin/activate
```
