Annual data on children aged under 16 y treated for asthma, including consumption of regular medication for asthma, numbers of hospital periods, lengths of hospitalizations and annual proportions of readmissions, were collected using patient-specific medical records from 1995 to 1999. In the Kuopio province, on average, 35.6-36.7/1000 children were on maintenance for asthma, of which 23% were receiving cromones, 51% were taking inhaled steroids and 26% were treated with cromones plus intermittent steroids. In the Oulu province, the respective prevalence was 32.7-34.9/1000, and the respective proportions were 5%, 93% and 2%. Total and first admissions, as well as hospital days were clearly less in the Oulu province. In the children aged>or = 6y, the average annual total admissions were 0.3/1000 (Oulu) vs 1.2/1000 (Kuopio) (p<0.001). Similarly, the first admissions were 0.2/1000 vs 1.0/1000 (p<0.001), proportions of readmissions 6.3% vs 19.3% (p<0.05), and numbers of hospital days 0.7/1000 vs 3.8/1000 (p<0.001). The differences were in the same direction, though less prominent, also among children 2-5 y of age.
