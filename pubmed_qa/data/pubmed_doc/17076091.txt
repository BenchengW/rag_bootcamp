We sought to determine whether patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) had an objective change in aerobic fitness during cycle ergometry compared to a normal population. The most accurate test of aerobic fitness is measurement of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) with cycle ergometry. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis (247 patients with OSA) of VO2max from annual cycle ergometry tests compared to a large control group (normative data from 1.4 million US Air Force tests) in a tertiary care setting. Overall, individuals with OSA had increased VO2max when compared to the normalized US Air Force data (p<.001). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased VO2max as compared to normalized values (p<.001). No differences in VO2max were observed after either medical or surgical therapy for OSA.
