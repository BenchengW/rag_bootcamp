The purpose of this study was to delineate early respiratory predictors of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from January 1987 to January 1997. Seventeen children with ARDS and malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation.
