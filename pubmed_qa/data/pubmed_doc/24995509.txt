To investigate the association between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the polymorphisms of HIF1A, a major vascular epithelial growth factor regulator under hypoxic conditions. The associations of AMD and polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied. Prospective study. Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) had dry type AMD. Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by dye-termination DNA sequencing. Genotype distribution of rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between genotypes and AMD subtypes. Given the significant difference between the mean age of case and control groups (72.13 ± 5.77 vs. 62.80 ± 5.22, respectively) (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy subjects.
