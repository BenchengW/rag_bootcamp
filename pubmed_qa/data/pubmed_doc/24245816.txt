To compare the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks of different bone mineral densities (BMDs) with and without cortical bone, and investigate whether some trabecular properties could influence primary stability. Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS). Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P≤.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P≤.05).
