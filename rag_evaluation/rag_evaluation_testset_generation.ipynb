    "# RAG Evaluation Test Set Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to use the [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) framework to generate a **test set** that can be used to evaluate the quality of a RAG pipeline. We then use the Python [langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) library to run some requests through this pipeline and we evaluate the quality of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- You will need an access key to OpenAI's API key, which you can sign up for at (https://dashboard.cohere.com/welcome/login). A free trial account will suffice, but will be limited to a small number of requests.\n",
    "- After obtaining this key, store it in plain text in your home in directory in the `~/.openai.key` file.\n",
    "- (Optional) Upload some pdf files into the `source_documents` subfolder under this notebook. We have already provided some sample pdfs, but feel free to replace these with your own."

The institute is committed to developing programming for Black and Indigenous students, postdoctoral fellows, and recent graduates to build research opportunities and expand career pathways in AI for historically underrepresented groups. Additionally, Vector is advancing the frontiers of AI knowledge by providing education in machine learning and deep learning concepts, supporting world-class faculty in new discoveries, and engineering new frontiers of AI application in industry, health, and government. They are also working with organizations to equip AI professionals to work safely with sensitive data and actively contributing expertise to policy issues related to AI adoption.\n",
