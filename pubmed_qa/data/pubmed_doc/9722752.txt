To evaluate the outcome of a new modification of percutaneous needle suspension, using a bone anchor system for fixing the suture at the public bone, and to compare the results with those published previously. From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (>2 years) were treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18). In the 37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%).
