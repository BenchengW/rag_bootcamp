The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of articular sounds, standardized clinical examination, and standardized articular ultrasound in the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. Forty patients and 20 asymptomatic volunteers underwent a standardized interview, physical examination, and static and dynamic articular ultrasound. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using magnetic resonance as the reference test. A total of 120 temporomandibular joints were examined. Based on our findings, the presence of articular sounds and physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement. Imaging by static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound demonstrates considerably lower sensitivity when compared with magnetic resonance. Some of the technical difficulties resulted from a limited access because of the presence of surrounding bone structures.
