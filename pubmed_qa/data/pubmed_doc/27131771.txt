The alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients received left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy are still unclear. The present study was to evaluate the influence of LAA occlusion device on echocardiography and ECG changes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Seventy-three patients who had undergone Watchman, LAmbre and Lefort were enrolled in this study. Echocardiography and ECG results at pre- and post-operation were collected. Besides, echocardiography was also performed during follow-up visits at 1, 6 and 12months after discharge. After LAA occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation.
