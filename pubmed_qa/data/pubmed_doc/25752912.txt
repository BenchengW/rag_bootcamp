To compare the probability of prenatal diagnosis (PND) and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) between fetuses conceived by assisted reproductive techniques (ART) and spontaneously-conceived fetuses with congenital heart defects (CHD). Population-based observational study. Paris and surrounding suburbs. Fetuses with CHD in the Paris registry of congenital malformations and cohort of children with CHD (Epicard). Comparison of ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses taking into account potential confounders (maternal characteristics, multiplicity and year of birth or TOPFA). Probability and gestational age at PND and TOPFA for ART-conceived versus spontaneously conceived fetuses. The probability of PND (28.1% versus 34.6%, P = 0.077) and TOPFA (36.2% versus 39.2%, P = 0.677) were not statistically different between ART-conceived (n = 171) and spontaneously conceived (n = 4620) fetuses. Estimates were similar after adjustment for potential confounders. Gestational age at PND tended to be earlier for ART fetuses (23.1 versus 24.8 weeks, P = 0.05) but no statistical difference was found after adjustment for confounders. Gestational age at TOPFA was comparable between ART-conceived and spontaneously conceived fetuses.
