The purpose of this study was to determine if registered dietitian (RD) and registered nurse (RN) certified diabetes educators (CDEs) provide similar recommendations regarding carbohydrates and dietary supplements to individuals with diabetes. A survey was mailed to CDEs in the southern United States. Participants were asked to indicate their recommendations for use of carbohydrates, fiber, artificial sweeteners, and 12 selected dietary and herbal supplements when counseling individuals with diabetes. The survey sample consisted of 366 CDEs: 207 were RNs and 159 were RDs. No statistically significant differences were found between RNs and RDs in typical carbohydrate recommendations for treatment of diabetes. However, RDs were more likely than RNs to make recommendations for fiber intake or use of the glycemic index. A significant difference also was found in the treatment of hypoglycemia: RNs were more likely than RDs to recommend consuming a carbohydrate source with protein to treat hypoglycemia.
